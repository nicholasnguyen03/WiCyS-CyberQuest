# WiCyS-CyberQuest
A multi-phase cybersecurity challenge involving steganography, hash cracking, decryption, and cyber-based riddles. Tools used: CyberChef, StegOnline, and CrackStation.


ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
Designing and building this Cyber Quest was a fun but complex process. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring a smooth and logical flow between phases. I wanted each part to build on the previous one without being too easy or too confusing, which proved harder than expected.

I tested the quest with several people, and their feedback revealed that some directions were unclear or caused confusionâ€”particularly in transitions between steps. This led me to rethink how I structured the instructions and how much guidance to provide without giving too much away. I'm still actively refining the experience to improve clarity and make it more intuitive.

From a technical standpoint, creating each phase brought its own challenges:

Hiding data in an image using StegOnline was tricky. If the user didnâ€™t input the parameters correctly (like row selection or format), the site would get stuck loading indefinitely. I had to ensure the instructions were clear enough to avoid this issue, while still keeping the challenge engaging.
For the hash challenge, finding a hash that was realistic to reverse involved testing multiple tools. Some online crackers like CrackStation worked quickly, while others were slow or inconsistent, making it difficult to choose the right level of challenge and accessibility.
Writing the riddle that hinted toward the correct decryption key took several revisions. It needed to be thematic, solvable, and actually useful in the next stepâ€”all without giving the answer away outright.
Designing the CyberChef decryption steps was also a process of trial and error. I had to test multiple encoding types and ciphers to find a combination that made sense, felt rewarding to solve, and matched the narrative of the quest.
Overall, itâ€™s still a work in progress, but seeing others engage with the challenge and provide feedback has made the creation process incredibly rewarding.
